2. Navigate into your new site’s directory in Visual Studio Code or another code edtior.
3. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code or another code editor.
4. Install the project dependencies with npm.
   ```shell
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
5. (1/2) Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add the API keys (provided over Microsoft Teams)

6. Start your website in development mode.
   ```shell
   npm run develop
   ```
7. Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`! You can visit your website in development mode through
   your Internet browser of choice, and check out `http://localhost:8000/kings`, `http://localhost:8000/ducks`,
   `http://localhost:8000/music`, or `http://localhost:8000` for the Hub.

   run the command

You may need to install commitizen globally.

### **Build and Deploy the website**

1. If you have development mode running, click into the Terminal window and hit CTRL-C for Mac.
2. Run the build command.

```shell
npm run build

3. Once the site finishes building (ie, it says ✨ Done in 30.22s. in the terminal window), you have the option to deploy the website by copy and pasting the contents of the **public/** folder into the web host directory of your choice.

touch .env
```

2. Copy the contents of .env.smaple into .env if not already present.
